These lines of code are part of a function that inserts a new node as the left child of a given parent node in a binary tree. Here's a step-by-step explanation of what each line does:

newNode->n = value;
This line sets the n field of the new node to the given value. n is presumably a field in the struct that defines each node in the binary tree, and holds the value stored in the node. This line simply assigns the value passed in as an argument to the n field of the new node.

newNode->parent = parent;
This line sets the parent field of the new node to point to the given parent node. parent is presumably a pointer to the parent node that we want to insert the new node as the left child of. By setting the parent field of the new node to point to this parent node, we establish the link between the two nodes - the new node is now a child of the parent node.

newNode->right = NULL;
This line initializes the right field of the new node to NULL. right is presumably a pointer to the right child of the new node. Since we are inserting the new node as the left child of its parent, the new node will not have a right child, so we initialize this field to NULL.

parent->left = newNode;
This line sets the left field of the parent node to point to the new node. left is presumably a pointer to the left child of the parent node. By setting this field to point to the new node, we establish the link between the parent node and the new node - the new node is now the left child of the parent node.

Together, these four lines of code create a new node, set its value to the given value, link it to its parent node, initialize its right field to NULL, and insert it as the left child of its parent node. This is a simple implementation of a binary tree node insertion operation.
